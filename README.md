# cs290-final

This is my final project for CS 290 - Web Development. It's a web site that allows users to register accounts, and record and track their weightlifting stats.

It incorporates several different technologies we learned in the class.
The UI makes use of JavaScript to interact with the user, including AJAX calls to seamlessly return data from the server.
Data is stored and retrieved from a MySQL database.
PHP is used to communicate between the frontend and the database.

Note that there are only very minor security measures (hashing account info with an md5 algorithm, basic string escaping), as security was not a primary focus on this class.
