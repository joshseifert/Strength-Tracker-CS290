  <h1>WHAT'S THIS MEATHEAD ALL ABOUT, ANYWAY?</h1>
  <p id="about">Don't worry, I'm not actually a meathead. After spending way, way too long on my 
  butt in front of the computer last quarter, I decided I needed to start exercising, so this site 
  is mostly the byproduct of me giving a serious go at lifting weights over the past 10 weeks.</p>
  
  <p>This site is an interface by which you can track your lifting progress, using most of the standard 
  "big" lifts - deadlift, squat, bench press, overhead press, and row. The lifts I chose are based on 
  the specific training program I use, <a href="http://stronglifts.com/">Stronglifts 5x5</a>, which I
  highly recommend for those interested in getting started in such an activity.</p>
  
  <p>The website itself: Users can create an account, and save their lifting stats to a database. The site 
  automatically saves the date you complete each lift. You can then retrieve those stats, viewing every 
  record you input, or you can filter your stats by lift, sorted with most recent records first. This 
  way, you can view your progress over time. The information you enter in the database is private, and 
  keeps track of each user's information separately. Of course, the most important part of lifting is making 
  sure that everyone around you knows that you lift, so you can also upload a tasteless selfie to share in 
  the gallery.</p>

  <p>In case it's not painfully apparent, this is poking fun at a lot of the macho culture inherent to 
  lifting weights. I'm at least marginally more well-spoken than this. Usually.</p>

  <p>Thanks for checking out my site.</p>
